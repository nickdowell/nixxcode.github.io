<p>The BEARDYTRON 5000 is a bespoke live performance music system built for <a href="http://www.beardyman.co.uk" target="tab">Beardyman</a> and compromises apps running on several iPads that control a custom Mac audio looper application that hosts various 3rd party effects.</p>
<p>I was brought onto this project to improve system performance as well as assisting with bug fixing and implementation of new features.</p>
